# uplift
This repo will be working/complete when we can use it to build, launch and use a Locational application.

This repo might eventually be known as the 'core' of Locational, but easier to build there and confirm (and rename repo), than expect we'll get there.

Will include:

- [ ] robust, and right-size build process
- [ ] link to CI/CD
- [ ] handling of configuration (or use of a module that does this)
- [ ] handling of routing and pages rendering (or use of a module that does this)
- [ ] handling of instantiation and running of a pipeline (or use of a module that does this)
- [ ] handling of rendering of data (or use of a module that does this)
